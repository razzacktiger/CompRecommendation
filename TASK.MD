6. **Hybrid ML Recommender System** üìã **PLANNED - January 25, 2025**

   - [ ] **Stage 1: Analytical Pre-filtering**
     - [ ] Narrow down to top 10-20 candidates per subject using rule-based scoring

## Discovered During Work

### January 25, 2025

**Task:** Top 3 Recommendation Ranking Fix

- **Problem:** Ranking ties cause inconsistent top 3 selections (only 29/88 subjects have exactly 3 recommendations)
- **Root Cause:** Multiple properties with identical composite scores receive same rank
- **Solution:** Implement proper tie-breaking using secondary criteria (distance, recency, property_id)
- **Results:** 83/88 subjects now have exactly 3 recommendations (5 subjects have fewer due to limited comparable data)
- **Quality:** 65.9% Excellent, 27.8% Good, 6.3% Fair recommendations in top 3
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Task:** Hybrid ML Recommender System Design

- **Goal:** Create appraiser-focused recommender that combines analytical + ML approaches
- **Approach:** 
  1. Analytical pre-filtering (rule-based, top 15 candidates)
  2. ML classification (learn from existing top 3 selections)
  3. Explainable hybrid scoring (30% analytical + 70% ML)
- **Target Users:** Professional appraisers who need defensible, explainable recommendations
- **Status:** üìã DESIGNED - Ready for implementation after ranking fix

### May 25, 2025

**Issue:** Properties DataFrame Field Mapping Bug

- **Problem:** 5 columns in `properties_cleaned.csv` had all null values due to incorrect field name mappings
- **Root Cause:** Field names in DataFrame creation didn't match actual raw data field names
- **Fixed:** Updated `cleaning.ipynb` DataFrame creation section with correct field mappings:
  - `state_province`: Fixed to use `'province'` field
  - `lot_size`: Fixed to use `'lot_size_sf'` field ‚Üí renamed to `lot_size_sqft`
  - `basement_finish`: Fixed to use `'basement'` field ‚Üí renamed to `basement_type`
  - `garage_spaces`: Removed (field doesn't exist) ‚Üí replaced with `main_level_finished_area`
  - `stories`: Fixed to use `'levels'` field ‚Üí renamed to `levels`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### January 25, 2025

**Task:** Notebook Refactoring & Organization

- **Problem:** `cleaning.ipynb` is 12,313 lines with significant repetitive code patterns
- **Goal:** Create organized, readable, maintainable notebook with reusable functions
- **Approach:** 3-phase refactoring (extract functions ‚Üí reorganize ‚Üí modularize)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
